The quantification and definition of climate change, extreme events and its implications for life and health on our planet is one of the major concerns in climate science. This book explains current statistical methods in climate science and their application. We do not aim to provide a comprehensive overview of all statistical methods in climate science, but rather to give an overview of the most important methods and their application. This book is the outcome of the seminar “Climate and Statistics” which took place in summer 2024 at the Department of Statistics, LMU Munich.
