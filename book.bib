   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {The univariate flood frequency analysis is widely used in hydrological studies. Often only flood peak or flood volume is statistically analyzed. For a more complete analysis the three main characteristics of a flood event i.e. peak, volume and duration are required. To fully understand these variables and their relationships, a multivariate statistical approach is necessary. The main aim of this paper is to define the trivariate probability density and cumulative distribution functions. When the joint distribution is known, it is possible to define the bivariate distribution of volume and duration conditioned on the peak discharge. Consequently volume-duration pairs, statistically linked to peak values, become available. The authors build trivariate joint distribution of flood event variables using the fully nested or asymmetric Archimedean copula functions. They describe properties of this copula class and perform extensive simulations to highlight differences with the well-known symmetric Archimedean copulas. They apply asymmetric distributions to observed flood data and compare the results those obtained using distributions built with symmetric copula and the standard Gumbel Logistic model. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed estimator, obtained as a solution of a pseudo-likelihood equation, is shown to be consistent, asymptotically normal and fully efficient at independence. A natural estimator of its asymptotic variance is proved to be consistent. Comparisons are made with alternative semiparametric estimators in the special case of Clayton's model for association in bivariate data. © 1995 Biometrika Trust.},

The most important models and methods in regression are presented on a solid formal basis, and their appropriate application is shown through many real data examples and case studies. Availability of (user-friendly) software has been a major criterion for the methods selected and presented. Thus, the book primarily targets an audience that includes students, teachers and practitioners in social, economic, and life sciences, as well as students and teachers in statistics programs, and mathematicians and computer scientists with interests in statistical modeling and data analysis. It is written on an intermediate mathematical level and assumes only knowledge of basic probability, calculus, and statistics. The most important definitions and statements are concisely summarized in boxes. Two appendices describe required matrix algebra, as well as elements of probability calculus and statistical inference.},

   abstract = {Complex environmental and hydrological processes are characterized by more than one correlated random variable. These events are multivariate and their treatment requires multivariate frequency analysis. Traditional analysis methods are, however, too restrictive and do not apply in many cases. Recent years have therefore witnessed numerous applications of copulas to multivariate hydrologic frequency analyses. This book describes the basic concepts of copulas, and outlines current trends and developments in copula methodology and applications. It includes an accessible discussion of the methods alongside simple step-by-step sample calculations. Detailed case studies with real-world data are included, and are organized based on applications, such as flood frequency analysis and water quality analysis. Illustrating how to apply the copula method to multivariate frequency analysis, engineering design, and risk and uncertainty analysis, this book is ideal for researchers, professionals and graduate students in hydrology and water resources engineering.},

It is based on employing goodness-of-fit test statistics directly into HAC estimation. The approach is summarized in a simple algorithm, its theoretical justification is given and its applicability is illustrated by several experiments, which include estimation of HACs involving up to five different Archimedean families.},

   abstract = {Parametric bivariate copula families have been known to flexibly capture various dependence patterns, e.g., either positive or negative dependence in either the lower or upper tails of bivariate distributions. In this paper, our objective is to construct a model that is adaptable enough to capture several of these features simultaneously. We propose a mixture of 4-way rotations of a parametric copula that can achieve this goal. We illustrate the construction using the Clayton family but the concept is general and can be applied to other families. In order to include dynamic dependence regimes, the approach is extended to a time-dependent sequence of mixture copulas in which the mixture probabilities are allowed to evolve in time via a moving average and seasonal types of relationship. The properties of the proposed model and its performance are examined using simulated and real data sets.},
