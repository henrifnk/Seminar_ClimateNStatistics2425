The most important models and methods in regression are presented on a solid formal basis, and their appropriate application is shown through many real data examples and case studies. Availability of (user-friendly) software has been a major criterion for the methods selected and presented. Thus, the book primarily targets an audience that includes students, teachers and practitioners in social, economic, and life sciences, as well as students and teachers in statistics programs, and mathematicians and computer scientists with interests in statistical modeling and data analysis. It is written on an intermediate mathematical level and assumes only knowledge of basic probability, calculus, and statistics. The most important definitions and statements are concisely summarized in boxes. Two appendices describe required matrix algebra, as well as elements of probability calculus and statistical inference.},

The proposed estimator, obtained as a solution of a pseudo-likelihood equation, is shown to be consistent, asymptotically normal and fully efficient at independence. A natural estimator of its asymptotic variance is proved to be consistent. Comparisons are made with alternative semiparametric estimators in the special case of Clayton's model for association in bivariate data. © 1995 Biometrika Trust.},

   abstract = {The univariate flood frequency analysis is widely used in hydrological studies. Often only flood peak or flood volume is statistically analyzed. For a more complete analysis the three main characteristics of a flood event i.e. peak, volume and duration are required. To fully understand these variables and their relationships, a multivariate statistical approach is necessary. The main aim of this paper is to define the trivariate probability density and cumulative distribution functions. When the joint distribution is known, it is possible to define the bivariate distribution of volume and duration conditioned on the peak discharge. Consequently volume-duration pairs, statistically linked to peak values, become available. The authors build trivariate joint distribution of flood event variables using the fully nested or asymmetric Archimedean copula functions. They describe properties of this copula class and perform extensive simulations to highlight differences with the well-known symmetric Archimedean copulas. They apply asymmetric distributions to observed flood data and compare the results those obtained using distributions built with symmetric copula and the standard Gumbel Logistic model. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The present work addresses this issue and proposes a new approach for estimating HACs that involve different Archimedean families. It is based on employing goodness-of-fit test statistics directly into HAC estimation.

   abstract = {Floods are among the most severe natural hazards, causing substantial damage and affecting millions of lives. These events are inherently multi-dimensional, requiring analysis across multiple factors. Traditional research often uses a bivariate framework relying on historical data, but climate change is expected to influence flood frequency analysis and flood system design in the future. This study assesses the projected changes in flood characteristics based on eight downscaled and bias-corrected General Circulation Models (GCMs) that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. The analysis considers two emission scenarios, including SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 for far-future (2070–2100), mid-term future (2040–2070), and historical (1982–2012) periods. Downscaled GCM outputs are utilized as predictors of the machine learning model to simulate daily streamflow. Then, a trivariate copula-based framework assesses flood events in terms of duration, volume, and flood peak in the Kan River basin, Iran. These analyses are carried out using the hierarchical Archimedean copula in three structures, and their accuracy in estimating the flood frequencies is ultimately compared. The results show that a heterogeneous asymmetric copula offers more flexibility to capture varying degrees of asymmetry across different parts of the distribution, leading to more accurate modeling results compared to homogeneous asymmetric and symmetric copulas. Also it has been found that climate change can influence the trivariate joint return periods, particularly in the far future. In other words, flood frequency may increase by approximately 50% in some cases in the far future compared to the mid-term future and historical period. This demonstrates that flood characteristics are expected to show nonstationary behavior in the future as a result of climate change. The results provide insightful information for managing and accessing flood risk in a dynamic environment.},

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In this paper, our objective is to construct a model that is adaptable enough to capture several of these features simultaneously. We propose a mixture of 4-way rotations of a parametric copula that can achieve this goal. We illustrate the construction using the Clayton family but the concept is general and can be applied to other families. In order to include dynamic dependence regimes, the approach is extended to a time-dependent sequence of mixture copulas in which the mixture probabilities are allowed to evolve in time via a moving average and seasonal types of relationship. The properties of the proposed model and its performance are examined using simulated and real data sets.},

This is supported by cluster analyses to identify areas of similar flood processes, both in terms of precipitation forcing and catchment processes. The results allow to isolate regions of similar flood generation processes including southerly versus westerly circulation patterns, effects of soil moisture seasonality due to evaporation and effects of soil moisture seasonality due to snow melt. In many regions of the Alpine-Carpathian range, there is a distinct shift in flood generating processes with flood magnitude as evidenced by a shift from summer to autumn floods. It is argued that the synoptic approach proposed here is valuable in both flood analysis and flood estimation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

These events are multivariate and their treatment requires multivariate frequency analysis. Traditional analysis methods are, however, too restrictive and do not apply in many cases. Recent years have therefore witnessed numerous applications of copulas to multivariate hydrologic frequency analyses. This book describes the basic concepts of copulas, and outlines current trends and developments in copula methodology and applications. It includes an accessible discussion of the methods alongside simple step-by-step sample calculations. Detailed case studies with real-world data are included, and are organized based on applications, such as flood frequency analysis and water quality analysis. Illustrating how to apply the copula method to multivariate frequency analysis, engineering design, and risk and uncertainty analysis, this book is ideal for researchers, professionals and graduate students in hydrology and water resources engineering.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the technical development and accuracy assessment of the most recent and improved version of the SoilGrids system at 250m resolution (June 2016 update). SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods—random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression—as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10–fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56\% (coarse fragments) and 83\% (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61\%. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230\%. Improvements can be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced. SoilGrids are available under the Open Data Base License.},

abstract = {Summary Attempts at explaining range limits of temperate tree species still rest on correlations with climatic data that lack a physiological justification. Here, we present a synthesis of a multidisciplinary project that offers mechanistic explanations. Employing climatology, biogeography, dendrology, population and reproduction biology, stress physiology and phenology, we combine results from in situ elevational (Swiss Alps) and latitudinal (Alps vs. Scandinavia) comparisons, from reciprocal common garden and phytotron studies for eight European broadleaf tree species. We show that unlike for low-stature plants, tree canopy temperatures can be predicted from weather station data, and that low-temperature extremes in winter do not explain range limits. At the current low-temperature range limit, all species recruit well. Transplants revealed that the local environment rather than elevation of seed origin dominates growth and phenology. Tree ring width at the range limit is not related to season length, but to growing season temperature, with no evidence of carbon shortage. Bud break and leaf emergence in adults trees are timed in such a way that the probability of freezing damage is almost zero, with a uniform safety margin across elevations and taxa. More freezing-resistant species flush earlier than less resistant species. Synthesis: we conclude that the range limits of the examined tree species are set by the interactive influence of freezing resistance in spring, phenology settings, and the time required to mature tissue. Microevolution of spring phenology compromises between demands set by freezing resistance of young, immature tissue and season length requirements related to autumnal tissue maturation.},

The degree to which the distribution of vegetation can be explained on the basis of climatic conditions depends in part on the proper selection of active climatic factors. Temperature and precipitation by themselves are poor descriptors of climate. Potential evapotranspiration, water surplus, and water deficit (combined in a moisture index) are found to be more useful. An analysis of the vegetation distribution in conterminous United States shows that the Thornthwaite moisture index and annual potential evapotranspiration are not only able to differentiate among the mid-latitude grassland, forest, and desert biochores but also to provide climatic limits for formation classes within each of the biochores. For example, it is possible to identify on the basis of numerical data an oak-hickory climate as distinct from the birch-maple, and a bunch grass climate distinct from the sagebrush. The problem of non-climatically controlled vegetation associations such as the low latitude pines and savanna are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract This study tests the ability of five Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), forced with observed climatology and atmospheric CO2, to model the contemporary global carbon cycle. The DGVMs are also coupled to a fast ?climate analogue model?, based on the Hadley Centre General Circulation Model (GCM), and run into the future for four Special Report Emission Scenarios (SRES): A1FI, A2, B1, B2. Results show that all DGVMs are consistent with the contemporary global land carbon budget. Under the more extreme projections of future environmental change, the responses of the DGVMs diverge markedly. In particular, large uncertainties are associated with the response of tropical vegetation to drought and boreal ecosystems to elevated temperatures and changing soil moisture status. The DGVMs show more divergence in their response to regional changes in climate than to increases in atmospheric CO2 content. All models simulate a release of land carbon in response to climate, when physiological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on plant production are not considered, implying a positive terrestrial climate-carbon cycle feedback. All DGVMs simulate a reduction in global net primary production (NPP) and a decrease in soil residence time in the tropics and extra-tropics in response to future climate. When both counteracting effects of climate and atmospheric CO2 on ecosystem function are considered, all the DGVMs simulate cumulative net land carbon uptake over the 21st century for the four SRES emission scenarios. However, for the most extreme A1FI emissions scenario, three out of five DGVMs simulate an annual net source of CO2 from the land to the atmosphere in the final decades of the 21st century. For this scenario, cumulative land uptake differs by 494?Pg?C among DGVMs over the 21st century. This uncertainty is equivalent to over 50 years of anthropogenic emissions at current levels.},
