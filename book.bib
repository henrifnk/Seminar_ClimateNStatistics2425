The most important models and methods in regression are presented on a solid formal basis, and their appropriate application is shown through many real data examples and case studies. Availability of (user-friendly) software has been a major criterion for the methods selected and presented. Thus, the book primarily targets an audience that includes students, teachers and practitioners in social, economic, and life sciences, as well as students and teachers in statistics programs, and mathematicians and computer scientists with interests in statistical modeling and data analysis. It is written on an intermediate mathematical level and assumes only knowledge of basic probability, calculus, and statistics. The most important definitions and statements are concisely summarized in boxes. Two appendices describe required matrix algebra, as well as elements of probability calculus and statistical inference.},

   abstract = {The univariate flood frequency analysis is widely used in hydrological studies. Often only flood peak or flood volume is statistically analyzed. For a more complete analysis the three main characteristics of a flood event i.e. peak, volume and duration are required. To fully understand these variables and their relationships, a multivariate statistical approach is necessary. The main aim of this paper is to define the trivariate probability density and cumulative distribution functions. When the joint distribution is known, it is possible to define the bivariate distribution of volume and duration conditioned on the peak discharge. Consequently volume-duration pairs, statistically linked to peak values, become available. The authors build trivariate joint distribution of flood event variables using the fully nested or asymmetric Archimedean copula functions. They describe properties of this copula class and perform extensive simulations to highlight differences with the well-known symmetric Archimedean copulas. They apply asymmetric distributions to observed flood data and compare the results those obtained using distributions built with symmetric copula and the standard Gumbel Logistic model. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It is based on employing goodness-of-fit test statistics directly into HAC estimation. The approach is summarized in a simple algorithm, its theoretical justification is given and its applicability is illustrated by several experiments, which include estimation of HACs involving up to five different Archimedean families.},

These events are inherently multi-dimensional, requiring analysis across multiple factors. Traditional research often uses a bivariate framework relying on historical data, but climate change is expected to influence flood frequency analysis and flood system design in the future. This study assesses the projected changes in flood characteristics based on eight downscaled and bias-corrected General Circulation Models (GCMs) that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. The analysis considers two emission scenarios, including SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 for far-future (2070–2100), mid-term future (2040–2070), and historical (1982–2012) periods. Downscaled GCM outputs are utilized as predictors of the machine learning model to simulate daily streamflow. Then, a trivariate copula-based framework assesses flood events in terms of duration, volume, and flood peak in the Kan River basin, Iran. These analyses are carried out using the hierarchical Archimedean copula in three structures, and their accuracy in estimating the flood frequencies is ultimately compared. The results show that a heterogeneous asymmetric copula offers more flexibility to capture varying degrees of asymmetry across different parts of the distribution, leading to more accurate modeling results compared to homogeneous asymmetric and symmetric copulas. Also it has been found that climate change can influence the trivariate joint return periods, particularly in the far future. In other words, flood frequency may increase by approximately 50% in some cases in the far future compared to the mid-term future and historical period. This demonstrates that flood characteristics are expected to show nonstationary behavior in the future as a result of climate change. The results provide insightful information for managing and accessing flood risk in a dynamic environment.},

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In this paper, our objective is to construct a model that is adaptable enough to capture several of these features simultaneously. We propose a mixture of 4-way rotations of a parametric copula that can achieve this goal. We illustrate the construction using the Clayton family but the concept is general and can be applied to other families. In order to include dynamic dependence regimes, the approach is extended to a time-dependent sequence of mixture copulas in which the mixture probabilities are allowed to evolve in time via a moving average and seasonal types of relationship. The properties of the proposed model and its performance are examined using simulated and real data sets.},

This is supported by cluster analyses to identify areas of similar flood processes, both in terms of precipitation forcing and catchment processes. The results allow to isolate regions of similar flood generation processes including southerly versus westerly circulation patterns, effects of soil moisture seasonality due to evaporation and effects of soil moisture seasonality due to snow melt. In many regions of the Alpine-Carpathian range, there is a distinct shift in flood generating processes with flood magnitude as evidenced by a shift from summer to autumn floods. It is argued that the synoptic approach proposed here is valuable in both flood analysis and flood estimation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

These events are multivariate and their treatment requires multivariate frequency analysis. Traditional analysis methods are, however, too restrictive and do not apply in many cases. Recent years have therefore witnessed numerous applications of copulas to multivariate hydrologic frequency analyses. This book describes the basic concepts of copulas, and outlines current trends and developments in copula methodology and applications. It includes an accessible discussion of the methods alongside simple step-by-step sample calculations. Detailed case studies with real-world data are included, and are organized based on applications, such as flood frequency analysis and water quality analysis. Illustrating how to apply the copula method to multivariate frequency analysis, engineering design, and risk and uncertainty analysis, this book is ideal for researchers, professionals and graduate students in hydrology and water resources engineering.},
